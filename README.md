## Home Office DDaT Playbook

This site is a reference for how we deliver digital and technology projects. 

Anyone can make changes to it if they have a Github account and have been added to the Home Office organisation on Github.

## Setting up for use on Github Pages

This site uses the Cayman theme as a base theme, then overrides defaults. To use this in Github pages:

1. First fork this repo
2. Then go to Settings
3. Scroll down to the Github Pages section
4. Choose a source - choose 'master branch' if you're not sure
5. Click the 'Change theme' button and choose the Cayman theme.
6. That's it. Your site will be available to the public at: https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/
