# Roadmaps
## Why use a roadmap?
Planning is vital to all activities – and in a product lifecycle, where you’re working with different teams, departments and dependencies, having a plan that keeps everyone focused on the desired outcomes for users is particularly vital.
A roadmap is a way to plan, implement and communicate how a product is developed, delivered and maintained. It’s designed to change over time, in response to fresh input from frequent user testing and changing circumstances.
How roadmaps look, what they should show and how they should be managed varies, but there are some principles that apply whether you use post-its on a wall, Excel, Trello or a specific tool designed for the purpose.
## Roadmap principles
* They are a communication tool, so should be simple and easy to understand. Use plain English and minimise clutter. You don’t need to include all the information here – it’s about sharing a vision of where you’re going and showing where you are now and what needs to happen to get there.
* Roadmaps are not a project plan, with strict dates and deliverables.
* For things that are coming up next, you might want to add more detail around roles and dates, so you can ensure you the team members and other stakeholders you need are available.
* They should provide value to specific teams – from senior stakeholders to contractors working on one part of a product. It’s fine to have multiple versions of a roadmap designed for different audiences so they have the information that’s useful for them.
* They must be kept up-to-date, showing when they were last updated and by whom. Roadmapping is a process, not a destination – they should be adjusted as you go along.
* Roadmaps should be open and shared widely.

## They should show:
* What you’re working on at the moment, and possibly what you’ve completed most recently.
* What your next priorities are.
* What isn’t on your horizon (what’s out of scope or not being dealt with yet).
* Any large ‘things’ to be aware of (e.g the date a piece of legislation goes live).
## How to make them:
Writing a roadmap is a collaborative process. Though the product manager (if there is one) is responsible for making them happen, they don't do it on their own:
1. Work out what needs to be done in order to achieve your product vision. This means stating what you’re aiming to achieve with the product. In other words, you're focussing on goals rather than how they are achieved.
    * If it's a new project there may be scope to bring in user research to understand the problem better prior to starting. If you're mid delivery you may be working on assumptions, but if you’re able to factor in user-testing at some point and can adjust the approach accordingly the product will always benefit.
    * You may also want to seek input from your stakeholders. If they’re not used to working in a product-centric way, they may tell you what features they want, rather than what the problem is. Work with them to understand the problem they’re trying to solve – as a team you may find a better solution.
1. Prioritise what needs to be done. This requires input from everyone on the team who will work to build it  – to map dependencies and size the different pieces of work. It often makes sense to do the smaller pieces first to confirm that you're on the right course and deliver value sooner.
1. Put your prioritised goals onto the roadmap in the order you’ll do them. You can include the most recent work to set the context and projects that are already underway. We recommend that you use Q1, Q2 etc, or "Now, next, future" rather than precise dates. Include any other factors that could impact things (major holidays when things slow down, events, or changes in policy etc.).
1. Depending on the size of your product and the capacity of your team, it may make sense to split your roadmap into multiple “swimlanes” that run in parallel over the same period of time. Each swimlane should be based around a high-level theme. If you've written a product vision and value proposition you'll use these to inform them. You may have multiple pieces of work running in parallel in different swimlanes.
1. For pieces of work or themes that are coming up next you may have more detail on how the goal will be achieved – typically implementation of a particular feature, but it could be an enabler (paying down tech debt for example) or a decision point. There's no need to get into that level of detail for areas that are further out on your roadmap.
1. The outcomes should have metrics associated with them to enable feedback and improvement.
1. It’s best not to go too far into the future with a roadmap because – things change!  6-12 months is generally the furthest out you can go with any certainty.
1. Communicate the roadmap to the team and to stakeholders frequently. It's a living document that you should review regularly.

### Key facts
* Roadmaps existed as post-it notes on the wall, various Excel spreadsheets and most recently in Roadmunk.
* They always used dates on their roadmaps because they had a fixed deadline relating to a legacy contract which had significant cost implications if it was missed.
* Metrics  – they measured digital uptake and customer satisfaction, but they are not responsible for driving users towards digital over paper.
### Summary
Anyone who’s ever applied for a passport in the old fashioned way will want to personally thank the team behind digitising the process. It’s now possible to apply for most types of passport entirely online. Even high-street photo-shops are happy, having been successfully designed into the process as third party enablers of the identity confirmation part of the process. HMPO was traditionally very waterfall, with design handing over to delivery – two totally separate organisations. The mindset is shifting to a realisation that if we’ve built things we also need to look after them. That means they need the capability and skills to keep the service running. Realising they can’t hand this over to anybody was a turning point. A senior stakeholder summed this up well when they said “once we stop iterating it becomes legacy.”
