When we buy off-the-shelf software, or pay someone else to build a system or service for us we must have that the right level of scrutiny and checks in place to make sure our services and systems are accessible. 

If you are buying (procuring) services or systems you must:  

* ask suppliers how accessibility their system are, or how they plan to build accessibility into the service they build for you 

* ensure that the contract with the supplier includes explicit requirements for accessibility 

* include a requirement for suppliers to continually monitor, improve and maintain their accessibility 

* ensure that the publication and maintenance of an accessibility statement is included within the requirements for the supplier 

More details of the steps you should take during procurement including template questions and contract clauses are available (internal Home Office link).
