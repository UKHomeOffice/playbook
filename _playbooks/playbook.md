# Home Office Playbook
This is where we share guidance, best practice and examples of working in a product-centric way. This means we build, deliver and maintain products iteratively, testing them with the people who use them and adjusting to ensure our products really meet their needs.
You may already be working in this way, or starting to adjust your approach. This is a centralised space where you can find guidance, reassurance and examples of best practice.

## Product Books
### What are they?
They’re a useful tool for articulating what your product is – what user needs it meets, how you intend to develop and deliver it, who will be involved in doing that, and (roughly) when, and how you’ll measure how well it’s working. They’re usually a deck that can be used in presentations or sent out to be read and referred to by whoever needs them.
### When should we make them?
Ideally, products would have one written when the process of building them begins. In practice, this often hasn’t happened. It’s useful to make one, wherever you are in the product lifecycle, to remind yourself and others of what you’re trying to accomplish and why and keep everyone focused on what matters – the outcome for users.
