Accessibility isn’t an add on, or nice to have. It’s a legal requirement.  

To ensure this is part of your team’s regular working practice (or baked in) you can consider it from the start, and make sure it’s embedded in your team’s ways of working. 

## Think about accessibility from the start 

You can start to consider accessibility by thinking about how people might use your service before you design, build or purchase anything. This helps:  

* identify problems early on 

* avoid designing or coding in accessibility issues 

* save time and money 

* ensure that contracts include accessibility 

* ensure we buy products and services which follow the Service Standard 

Find out more about accessibility testing during development phases in the government service manual. 


## Embed accessibility into your processes 

You can: 

* include accessibility as acceptance criteria on user stories (the tasks your delivery team are working on) 

* have accessibility as part of your definition of done (the quality checks before making something live) 

* include accessibility testing in unit and integration tests – don’t leave testing for accessibility until UAT 

* use GDS or Home Office design systems as the basis for your work – they’ve got accessibility built in by default 

* include questions on accessibility if you are tendering for suppliers or software 

* make sure contracts with suppliers (to build or buy systems) have explicit accessibility requirements 


## Make sure your team members know how they are involved  

[Everyone in your team](https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/playbook/team/) should help with accessibility.  

For example your:

* content designer will design accessible content
* developer will make the frontend accessible
* user researcher will test this with users.
