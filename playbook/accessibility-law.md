Your website or service must be accessible to everyone who needs to use it. This is not optional or nice to have. Itâ€™s essential and required by the law. 

## Why this is important  

All Home Office digital services are expected to meet the UK Government service standard for accessibility. By meeting the standards, you create a service which: 

* more people can use   

* is easier for people to use 

* meets [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/made) 

Why [accessibility is good for business](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#is-there-a-business-case-for-accessibility) is explained on the Web accessibility initiative (W3C) website. 


The UK government accessibility standards state your service must: 

* meet the minimum of [level AA of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)  

* have an accessibility statement stating how the service meets the WCAG guidelines, if there are any known issues or workarounds and how to get support or making a complaint 

* work on commonly used browsers and assistive technologies 

* have been informed by research and tested with people with disabilities
