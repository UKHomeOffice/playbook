Your website or service must be accessible to everyone who needs to use it. This is not optional or nice to have. Itâ€™s essential and required by the law. 

## UK government accessibility standards 

These are the standards your service must meet to ensure everyone can use it. To make sure your service meets the law, you must make sure that it: 

* meets the minimum of [level AA of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)  

* has an [accessibility statement](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/playbook/edit/master/playbook/accessibility-statement) stating how the service meets the WCAG guidelines, if there are any known issues or workarounds and how to get support or making a complaint 

* works on commonly used browsers and assistive technologies 

* has been informed by research and testing with people with disabilities and access needs

## Why this is important  

All Home Office digital services are expected to meet the UK Government service standard for accessibility. By meeting the standards, you create a service which: 

* more people can use   

* is easier for people to use 

* meets [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/made) 

Why [accessibility is good for business](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#is-there-a-business-case-for-accessibility) is explained on the Web accessibility initiative (W3C) website.
