When we buy off-the-shelf software, or pay someone else to build a system or service for us we must have that the right level of scrutiny and checks in place to make sure our services and systems are accessible. 

If you are buying (procuring) services or systems you must:  

* ask suppliers how accessibility their system are, or how they plan to build accessibility into the service they build for you
