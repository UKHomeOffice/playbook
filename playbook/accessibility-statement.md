Most websites and services need an accessibility statement to comply with public sector regulatory requirements. 

See the Home Office guidance on [accessibility statements](https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/playbook/accessibility-statement/) for more detail (internal link).  

You should: 

* carry out accessibility tests first and use that information to write an accessibility statement.  

* use the Home Office guidance on creating an accessibility statement and the Government Digital Service Accessibility Statement template  

* ensure that your statement includes a timeline for remediation, appropriate workarounds (where applicable) and routes for escalation 

* keep your statement up to date with changes to your product, updating known issues, timelines and workarounds 

Get your statement reviewed by the Accessibility and Inclusion team to ensure that itâ€™s in line with regulatory requirements.
