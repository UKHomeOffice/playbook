It’s possible to test for accessibility at every stage of development. 

To meet [government standards](https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/playbook/accessibility-law/), you need to carry out these checks:  

* conduct research with people with access needs  

* use software to carry out basic accessibility tests (internal link)  

* ask a quality assurance tester to carry out more in-depth tests  

* test your service on assistive technologies like screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools  

* test your service with people who use assistive technologies (fix existing issues first, so they have the best chance of completing tasks and can provide useful insights)  

Do these tests first.  

If you need more help contact the Accessibility and Inclusion Team.  


## If you can’t carry out accessibility tests  

In some circumstances a service manager may find it hard to conduct a detailed accessibility check or to fix accessibility issues.  

If this is the case contact the Accessibility and Inclusion Team who can help with this by providing advice or signposting to additional resources.
