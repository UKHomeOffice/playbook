You must make sure your website or service is accessible to everyone who needs to use it. This is not optional or nice to have. It’s essential and required by the law. 

## Why this is important  

All Home Office digital services are expected to meet the UK Government service standards for accessibility. By meeting the standards, you create a service which: 

* more people can use   

* is easier for people to use 

* meets Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 

Why [accessibility is good for business](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#is-there-a-business-case-for-accessibility) is explained on the Web accessibility initiative (W3C) website. 


The UK government accessibility standards state your service must: 

* meet the minimum of level AA of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1  

* have an accessibility statement stating how the service meets the WCAG guidelines 

* work on commonly used browsers and assistive technologies 

* have been informed by research and tested with people with disabilities 


###  How to make sure your service is accessible  

#### Consider accessibility from the beginning 

Start thinking about how people might use your service before you design or build anything. This helps:  

* identify problems early on 

* avoid designing or coding in accessibility issues 

* save time and money 

Find out more about accessibility testing during development phases in the government service manual. 

 

### Ensure accessibility is ‘baked in’ 

Accessibility isn’t an add on, or nice to have. It’s a legal requirement.  

To ensure this is part of your team’s regular working practice (or baked in) you can: 

* include accessibility as acceptance criteria on user stories (the tasks your delivery team are working on) 

* have accessibility as part of your definition of done (the quality checks before making something live) 

Everyone in your team (link to your team section) should help with accessibility. For example, your content designer will design accessible content and your developer will make the frontend accessible, and your user researcher will test this with users.  

See Home Office guidance on how different roles ensure inclusion and accessibility (internal link) 

 

### Carry out accessibility testing  

It’s possible to test for accessibility at every stage of development. To meet government standards, you need to carry out these checks:  

* conduct research with people with access needs  

* use software to carry out basic accessibility tests (internal link)  

* ask a quality assurance tester to carry out more in-depth tests  

* test your service on assistive technologies like screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools  

* test your service with people who use assistive technologies (fix existing issues first, so they have the best chance of completing tasks and can provide useful insights)  

Do these tests first. If you need more help contact the Accessibility and Inclusion Team.  

#### If you can’t carry out accessibility tests  

In some circumstances a service manager may find it hard to conduct a detailed accessibility check or to fix accessibility issues. If this is the case contact the Accessibility and Inclusion Team who can help with this. 


## Have an up-to-date accessibility statement 

Most websites and services need an accessibility statement. See the Home Office guidance on accessibility statements for more detail (internal link).  

Carry out accessibility tests first and use that information to write an accessibility statement.  

## Home office governance (FW Note – I made this bit up, I am not sure what the rules are here! Please advise) 

You should attend a Home Office peer review to prove that you have carried out accessibility checks to meet point 5 of the service standards: Make sure everyone can use the service. 

Your service may be delayed from launching if you do not meet the standard. Contact your head of role for more information.
