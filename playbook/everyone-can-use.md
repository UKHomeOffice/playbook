Your website or service must be accessible to everyone who needs to use it. This is not optional or nice to have. It’s essential and required by the law. 

## Why this is important  

All Home Office digital services are expected to meet the UK Government service standards for accessibility. By meeting the standards, you create a service which: 

* more people can use   

* is easier for people to use 

* meets [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/made) 

Why [accessibility is good for business](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#is-there-a-business-case-for-accessibility) is explained on the Web accessibility initiative (W3C) website. 


The UK government accessibility standards state your service must: 

* meet the minimum of [level AA of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)  

* have an accessibility statement stating how the service meets the WCAG guidelines, if there are any known issues or workarounds and how to get support or making a complaint 

* work on commonly used browsers and assistive technologies 

* have been informed by research and tested with people with disabilities 


###  How to make sure your service is accessible  

#### Consider accessibility from the beginning 

Start thinking about how people might use your service before you design or build anything. This helps:  

* identify problems early on 

* avoid designing or coding in accessibility issues 

* save time and money 

Find out more about accessibility testing during [development phases in the government service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction#what-to-do-about-accessibility-in-discovery). 

### Carry out an accessibility risk assessment  

All Home Office websites, online services and mobile apps must complete an [accessibility risk assessment](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/A11y/Accessibility+Risk+Assessment?preview=/82355878/82356153/Accessibility%20Risk%20Assessment%20tool_V2%20(1).xlsx)(internal link). This also includes software we buy, build ourselves of pay others to build. 

This helps to identify the level of accessibility risk a service may pose. It could be something like the reputational or legal risk of an inaccessible service going live, or the risk created by not having suitable skilled individuals within a delivery team. 

The output from the assessment helps the Accessibility and Inclusion team to: 

* provide support to your team  

* track the overall accessibility risk  

### Buying accessible systems or services 

When we buy off the shelf software, or pay someone else to build a system or service for us we must have that the right level of scrutiny and checks in place to make sure our services and systems are accessible 

If you are procuring services or systems you must:  

* ask suppliers how accessibility their system are, or how they plan to build accessibility into the service they build for you 

* ensuring that the contract with the supplier includes explicit requirements for accessibility 

* including a requirement for suppliers to continually monitor, improve and maintain their accessibility 

* ensuring that the publication and maintenance of an accessibility statement is included within the requirements for the supplier 

Read more details of the steps you should take during procurement including [template questions and contract clauses](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/A11y/Accessible+Procurement).  

### Ensure accessibility is ‘baked in’ 

Accessibility isn’t an add on, or nice to have. It’s a legal requirement.  

To ensure this is part of your team’s regular working practice (or baked in) you can: 

* include accessibility as acceptance criteria on user stories (the tasks your delivery team are working on) 

* have accessibility as part of your definition of done (the quality checks before making something live) 

* include accessibility testing in unit and integration tests  – don’t leave testing for accessibility until UAT 

* use GDS or Home Office design systems as the basis for your work – they’ve got accessibility built in by default 

* include questions on accessibility if you are tendering for suppliers or software 

* make sure contracts with suppliers (to build or buy systems) have explicit accessibility requirements 

[Everyone in your team](https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/playbook/team/) should help with accessibility. For example, your content designer will design accessible content, your developer will make the frontend accessible, and your user researcher will test this with users.  

See Home Office guidance on how different roles ensure inclusion and accessibility (internal link) 

 

### Carry out accessibility testing  

It’s possible to test for accessibility at every stage of development. To meet government standards, you need to carry out these checks:  

* conduct research with people with access needs  

* use software to carry out basic accessibility tests (internal link)  

* ask a quality assurance tester to carry out more in-depth tests  

* test your service on assistive technologies like screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools  

* test your service with people who use assistive technologies (fix existing issues first, so they have the best chance of completing tasks and can provide useful insights)  

Do these tests first. 
If you need more help contact the Accessibility and Inclusion Team.  

#### If you can’t carry out accessibility tests  

In some circumstances a service manager may find it hard to conduct a detailed accessibility check or to fix accessibility issues. If this is the case contact the Accessibility and Inclusion Team who can help with this. 


## Have an up-to-date accessibility statement 

Most websites and services need an accessibility statement to comply with public sector regulatory requirements. See the Home Office guidance on accessibility statements for more detail (internal link).  

You should: 

* carry out accessibility tests first and use that information to write an accessibility statement.  

* use the Home Office guidance on creating an accessibility statement and the Government Digital Service Accessibility Statement template  

* ensure that your statement includes a timeline for remediation, appropriate workarounds (where applicable) and routes for escalation 

* keep your statement up to date with changes to your product, updating known issues, timelines and workarounds 

Get your statement reviewed by the Accessibility and Inclusion team to ensure that it’s in line with regulatory requirements.  

## Home office governance 

This is being considered. 

 

## Home Office support, guidance and training

The Accessibility and Inclusion team can provide support to services, however, it’s important to note that they are a small, centralised team and the support they can provide to individual services will vary. 

These links will only work for Home Office staff and suppliers.

### Home Office Training 

There are a number of [training programmes](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/A11y/Accessibility+Home) for Home Office staff including:

* Introduction to Access Needs 

* User research and Access Needs 

* Screen reader training 

* online training
