You need to consider the problem you're trying to solve for your users. Looking at the context of what your users are trying to achieve can help.


## Why this is important  

The aim of a service or product is often for a user to complete a task or find out some information.  

These tasks are rarely isolated, they are usually part of a wider journey for the user. Itâ€™s important to consider this journey, or you may risk fixing one area while pushing problems on to somewhere else.   

Looking at the context for the user helps you:  

* understand the problems that you are trying to solve 

* define outcomes to the problems, that you can then evaluate 

* consider the scope of your product or service  

* avoid focusing on a solution too soon 

 

## How to meet this principle  

 

### Actions to take 

Frame the problem

Consider your target outcomes and measures

Plot the user experience 

 

### When to do this  

If you are using Agile delivery processes then this should be considered at the very beginning before, or in early discovery.  

 - including setting target outcomes and metrics to measure - these then can be revisited and should remain present throughout the lifecycle.  

they should be used as reference points - to focus team activity: what problem are we trying to solve? what outcomes are we trying to achieve? how do we know its working? Do we need to pivot? 

 

### If you are not using Agile processes  

If you are not running an Agile delivery, or you have skipped the discovery phase, then it's still useful to carry out these tasks as it helps you to fully understand the scope of your work and to know when it's complete.

## Who can help  

The UCD practice can help with:  

* how user research and service design can help you plot the users' experience  

* workforce planning  

* collaborating in the co-lab to work on problems and outcomes  

 

CTO product can help with:  

* workshopping ideas or carry out a peer review to see how you have met this principle 

* preparing docs for approvals board Case studies and examples xxxxxx "
