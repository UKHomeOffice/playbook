It’s important to have the right roles working closely together on your team. If you don’t have the expertise you need you risk creating the wrong solution, or not meeting the outcome you want to achieve. 

The roles that are needed can differ, depending on: 

* the delivery method you are using 

* the phase of the delivery lifecycle your service is at 

* if your service has a user-interface 



## Roles needed in agile delivery phases 

The skills you need will change during the lifecycle of your service. Read more about the roles you’ll need at each service phase in the government service manual. 

 

## Roles needed in services with user interfaces (UI) 

If your service or product has a user-interface (for example a website, an app, or forms that users complete) then you will need to a user-centred design (UCD) team working on your service design.  

The roles needed on a UCD team are listed below, and are also explained in the in the government service manual.

## Roles needed in a user-centred design (UCD) team 

If your team is working on a service that has a user interface, then you will need to have a multidisciplinary team which includes specialists in user-centred design (UCD).   

A default user-centred multidisciplinary team would include the roles already listed, and: 

### User researcher 

Research informs policy, proposition, service, content and interaction design, ensuring digital services work well for users and achieve policy aims. 

User researchers lead on discovery research and analysis, they capture user needs, develop the service research strategy and usability test designs.  

###  Content designer 

Content designers make sure appropriate and clear content is shown to users in the right place and in the best format. They work closely with User Researchers and Interaction Designers to test ideas, challenge assumptions and propose design solutions based on user needs. 

### Designer 

Designers work alongside researchers and developers to design user-centred accessible services that are simple enough for everyone to use. 
They determine the best way for users to interact with services, the overall flow and individual design elements.
